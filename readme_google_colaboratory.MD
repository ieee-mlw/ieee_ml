All the IPython notebooks can also be executed on google colaboratory, which provides a Jupyter notebook environment on the cloud without the need for any set-up.

Firstly, open Google Drive and select the Colab Notebooks dorectory under Folders.

Now, select New and upload desired File or Folder. In the below screenshot, I uploaded the ieee_ml directory from my local machine.

After uploading this directory,select a desired IPython notebook and double click on it. Then, select Colaboratory to open.

The above screnshot shows xor_combined.ipynb opened in Colaboratory. In each cell press Shift+Enter to run that cell. 

After running all the cells in this manner, we can see the results obtained in the screenshot below.

Note: Comment debuggers (Tensorboard and CLI) before executing ipynb files on colaboratory.
